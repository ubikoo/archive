/** ---- ShellSort implementation ---------------------------------------------
 *
 * class ShellSort
 * @brief ShellSort implements the array shell sort algorithm.
 *
 * ShellSort is a simple extension of insertion sort where instead
 * of insert sort with steps of 1, we insert sort with steps of h.
 *
 * For example, when sorting a N size array in increasing order,
 * if the smallest element is the last, one would need N-1 exchanges
 * to get the element to its initial position. By taking larger steps
 * one is able to bring the element to its destination faster.
 *
 * By taking a series of h-sorted sequences with smaller h-steps,
 * less number of exchanges would need to be performed to achieve the
 * final order. The last h-step would be 1 at which point the sort
 * is equivalent to insertion sort. However, at that point, the array
 * is partially sorted already so less number of exchanges are needed.
 *
 * API ShellSort<Item>:
 *      ShellSort()       create an insertion sort object
 *      ~ShellSort()      destroy an insertion sort object
 *
 *      void sort() (std::vector<Item> &arr, Compare<Item> comp)
 *
 *          sort an array, keeping the invariant comp(a[j],a[i]) for j < i.
 *          The comparison predicate defines the order of items in the array.
 *          The default is std::less<Item> and sorts the array in increasing
 *          order, (a[j] < a[i]) for j < i.
 *
 * @note
 * The binary predicate is declared as a std::function to allow the use of
 * comparison callbacks of different types - lambdas, functors and function
 * pointers.
 *
 * @see Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne.

         *
         * Compute the largest h-step that can be used for an array
