class UnionFind:
    """
    UnionFind implements a disjoint set data structure.
    It supports union and find operations on the sets, together with a count
    operation that returns the total number of components.
    This implementation uses the weighted-union by size with path compression
    during the find operation.

    UnionFind solves a dynamic connectivity problem. The input is taken as a
    sequence of pairs of integers, where each integer represents an object of
    some type.
    The pair p and q are to be interpreted as meaning p "is connected to" q.
    The term "is connected to" is assumed to be an equivalence relation:
        symmetric:  if p is connected to q, then q is connected to p.
        transitive: if p is connected to q and q is connected to r,
                    then p is connected to r.
        reflexive:  p is connected to p.

    The underlying data structure is a site indexed array which maintains the
    invariant that p and q are connected if and only if the root parent of p
    is equal to the root parent of q.
    The find operation returns the canonical element of the set containing a
    given element.
    The join operation merges the set containing element p with the set
    containing element q. Which root parent becomes child is determined by the
    rank (or size) of the sets.

    API UnionFind:
        UnionFind()     create an empty disjoint-set data structure.

        n_keys()        return the number of keys.
        n_sets()        return the number of sets.
        size(p)         return the size of the tree containing p
        contains(p)     does the union-find ensemble contain the p-key?
        connected(p, q) do p and q keys belong to the same component?
        find(p)         find the canonical component of element p
        join(p, q)      merge set containing p with set containing q

                        all the keys contained in the component.
